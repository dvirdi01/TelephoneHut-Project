# TelephoneHut:The Modern Phonebook

## What is the TelephoneHut?

For my Personal Project, I will be designing a TelephoneHut which is a Phonebook application where users can store, 
modify, or retrieve their contacts, manage calls, and view their calling history. Similar to a phonebook app built 
inside our phones, TelephoneHut is a smart phonebook application that provides people with a simple yet secure way to 
store their contacts’ personal information all in one place. Although this application is easy to use, its sophisticated 
design features allow users to add ample amounts of details regarding their contacts. Rather than just saving people’s 
names, the user can also add additional details about their contacts, such as their email IDs, and what type of category 
they belong in (*FAMILY, FRIEND, or WORK*). Along with that, this application allows users to track the number of calls 
they have made and view their calling history so that they can reflect on their daily usage of this app as well. 
TelephoneHut is designed for people of all ages, and it can be easily accessed through one’s desktop. With the 
continuous innovations in technology, many people keep updating their phones to keep up with the latest trends. With the 
ever-changing designs of phones and apps, it also becomes more difficult for the older generation to keep track of the 
trending cell phone features. Nevertheless, the simplicity of TelephoneHut is particularly useful for elders as they 
can use it to easily store and retrieve their contacts in a secure manner.

I am interested in making my TelephoneHut because I think it will be a great way for me to get acquainted with how I can
build a user-friendly application that can be used by everyone. TelephoneHut can provide users with an alternative way 
to store their contacts in their laptops or computers. Consequently, if someone happens to lose or damage their phone, 
they would not run the risk of losing all their contacts. Moreover, I want to get a taste of what app designing looks 
like. Although this project is just a desktop application, I want to hone my creativity by designing a project that 
functions like a real app. Choosing to design a phonebook application will allow me to learn more about coding in Java 
and how I can build a sophisticated application, which will help me build more projects in the future as well.
