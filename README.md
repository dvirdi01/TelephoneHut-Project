# My Personal Project: Phonebook

## Project Overview

For my Personal Project, I aim to design a Phonebook application where users can store, modify, or retrieve their contacts, manage calls, and view their calling history. Similar to a phonebook app built inside our phones, this Java desktop application provides people with a simple way to store their contacts’ personal information. Rather than just saving people’s names, the user can add additional details about their contacts, such as their email IDs, and what type of category they belong in (FAMILY, FRIEND, or WORK). This application also allows users to keep track of the number of calls they have made in their phone books to reflect on their daily usage of this app. It is designed for people of all ages as it can be easily accessed through one’s desktop. With the ever-changing designs of phones and applets, it becomes more difficult for the older generation to keep track of the new cell phone features. The Phonebook that I will be designing will also be useful for elders as they can store their contacts securely in one place where they can easily access them.

I am interested in making a Phonebook because I want to make an application that will be useful for everyone in the future as it can provide users with an alternative way for them to store their contacts. If someone happens to lose or damage their phone, they would not run the risk of losing all their contacts. Moreover, I want to hone my creativity by designing a project that looks like a real app would. Therefore, this project will give me a chance to build a sophisticated Phonebook application, which will help me build more projects in the future as well.
